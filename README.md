# Mathematical_Transfromation
There are two types of Data Distribution one Normal and another Non-Normal Distribution 
Normal Distribution := Bell Curve
Non Normal-Distribution := Skewed, Uniform, HeavyTailed, PoissonsDistribution, Cauchy Distribution.
Why to convert?
ML Model = Linear-regression , Non-linear regression. Only We can use this if this data is in the Normal Distribution.
Non-Normal:
1.Skewed distribution : a.Left Distribution(Negative Distribution) and b.Right Distribution(Positive Distributoin)
2.Uniform distribution : (Same for all values)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Uniform Distribution cannot be converted into Normal Distribution or any other Distribution.
uniform distribution has equal probability distribution so, uniform distribution we cannot do anything.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# There are many methods which can be used to convert the Skewed Distribution into the Normal Distribution:
1.Logarithmic Distribution.
2.SquareRoot Distribution.
